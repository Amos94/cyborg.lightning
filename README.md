This is the repository for Cyborg Lightning team. PROJECT RUN/ KCL.
ProjectRun was the task set to us by a client to create and social messaging application
which search's for users with similar interest and allows communication between one another. 

Google Cloud Messaging was used to handle push notifications can be found at:
https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/
We chose to use GCM because this was a free alternative compared to other services
out there on the market and its the eastiest to maintain. 

Yalantis was used to create the Guillotine Navigation draw:
https://github.com/Yalantis/GuillotineMenu-Android.git

Webhost for SQL/PHP can be found at: 
Hostinger.co.uk
Hostinger had all the functions we need for this application to work 
costing us nothing and was also the easiest to manage and maintain.

The Domain for all PHP files used within the app can be found at:

The SIP provider for the SIP communication can be found at:
www.antisip.com
Antisip is a free SIP provider.
As we wanted to make the application fully free, with an unlimited number of users
and an unlimited numbers of calls and messages, we had to find a free SIP provider.
Antisip is one of those.
We choose them because of their quality, and because of their simpistic  register page.
They will provide SIP services for free. So our client won't need to pay after a number of users
or after a number of minutes/ messages as other Companies charge.
Some of NON FREE companies are: Snitch, CallOnSip or videoBlox.
We wanted to improve the users experience and reduce the costs for our client (make everything free of charge).
Furthermore, if the client will want in the future to extend his business nad to buy his own servers and be a sip provider,
the application allow this as well, by changing some parameters in the CallActivity code. (The FINAL ones)
and this WebView won't be needed anymore.
